How It Works

Backend:
Pulls the image shreybatra/sample-backend.
Connects to Redis using the environment variable REDIS_URI.
Exposed internally via the backend-svc service.
Frontend:
Pulls the image shreybatra/sample-frontend.
Communicates with the backend using the environment variable BACKEND_URL.
Exposed externally via the frontend-svc service (NodePort).
Redis:
Pulls the official redis image.
